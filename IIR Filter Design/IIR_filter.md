This repository contains the solutions and analysis focusing on the design and evaluation of FIR and IIR filters using MATLAB. The assignment explores the trade-offs and performance metrics of various filter design methods, including Butterworth, Chebyshev I & II, Elliptic, Equiripple, and Kaiser window methods.
