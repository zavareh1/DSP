This repository contains some of the nice stuff in signals and systems (mostly discrete time signal processing).

1- FFT Leakage Windowing:
FFT leakage occurs when a signal's frequency components do not align perfectly with the FFT bin frequencies, causing energy to spread across multiple bins. This can distort the spectral representation, reduce frequency resolution, and make it difficult to accurately measure the amplitude and frequency of the signal.
