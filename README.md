# DSP
This repository contains some of the nice stuff in Discrete-Time Signal Processing, including:

1- FFT Leakage Windowing:
FFT leakage occurs when a signal's frequency components do not align perfectly with the FFT bin frequencies, causing energy to spread across multiple bins. This can distort the spectral representation, reduce frequency resolution, and make it difficult to accurately measure the amplitude and frequency of the signal.

2- LPF_BPF Filter Design by Parks-McClellan and Kaiser window methods
Designing lowpass and bandpass filters with specified requirements and comparing the Parks-McClellan and Kaiser window methods.

3- IIR Filter Design
This repository contains the solutions and analysis focusing on the design and evaluation of FIR and IIR filters using MATLAB. The assignment explores the trade-offs and performance metrics of various filter design methods, including Butterworth, Chebyshev I & II, Elliptic, Equiripple, and Kaiser window methods.
